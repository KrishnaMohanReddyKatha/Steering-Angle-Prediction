In this project, steering angle of the car is predicted by looking at the images of the track ahead.

* Used the open source car simulator to collect training data and evaluate the model in autonomous mode.
* Built Nvidia end to end autonomous driving CNN architecture in Keras to predict steering angles from images
* Trained the model on AWS EC2 GPU instance and validated the model using validation set
* Tested the model to predict steering angle of car in autonomous mode and car has successfully driven around track without leaving the road
